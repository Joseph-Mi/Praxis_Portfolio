              <p className={styles.small}>
              I believe one of the most important ideals within engineering design is growth and development. Engineering is defined as the practice of solving technical problems, increasing efficiency, and improving systemsâ€”a strive for betterment. Aligning with this pursuit, I aim to create things that drive the world to be better. Day by day, I aim for myself to be better. It is not the creation of something perfect that brings me the feeling of accomplishment, but the creation of something that both improves the current situation and can be improved to accommodate for changing circumstances.

              <h3>Morality</h3>
              <p>
              While success in engineering design can be interpreted in various ways, I believe it should always be pursued with a foundation of righteousness. Whatever my goals or creations may be, I am committed to maintaining moral integrity throughout the process.

              <p>
                My ambition keeps me accountable, encouraging me to set goals beyond the status quo. I thrive on challenging myself, and I believe that this is where learning truly occurs. As a student, I have recognized that failures, as successes, are stepping stones to growth. This pursuit of excellence motivates me to challenge my limits and advance both personally and professionally.
